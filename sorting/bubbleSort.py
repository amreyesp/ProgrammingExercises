"""Sorting: Bubble Sort"""
"""
Considering the Bubble sort algorithm, given an array of integers, sort the array
in ascending order using it. Once sorted, print the following three lines:
1.Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where  numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
2.First Element: firstElement, where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
3.Last Element: lastElement, where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.
