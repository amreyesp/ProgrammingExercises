"""Frequency Queries"""
"""
You are given q queries. Each query is of the form two integers described below:
- 1x : Insert x in your data structure.
- 2y : Delete one occurence of y from your data structure, if present.
- 3z : Check if any integer is present whose frequency is exactly z. If yes,
print 1 else 0.

The queries are given in the form of a 2-D array queries of q size  where q[i][0]
contains the operation, and queries[i][1] contains the data element. For example,
you are given array queries = [(1,1),(2,2),(3,2),(1,1),(1,1),(2,1),(3,2)].
