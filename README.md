# ProgrammingExercises
A repository with the resolution of some stereotypical programming exercises for developers

## Typical
**FizzBuzz Test:** is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag. The text of the programming assignment is as follows:
"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

**Program for Conway’s Game Of Life:** Initially, there is a grid with some cells which may be alive or dead. Our task to generate the next generation of cells based on the following rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Warmup
**Sock Merchant:** John works at a clothing store. He has a large pile of socks that he must pair by color for sale. Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are. For example, there are 7 socks with ar=[1,2,1,2,1,3,2] colors . There is one pair of color 1 and one of color 2. There are three odd socks left, one of each color. The number of pairs is 2.
